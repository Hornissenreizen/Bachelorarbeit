- prove: I(X;Y) approaches 0 if and only if X and Y approach to be independent?
- model framework I(X,Y) -> I(X;Y) DONE
- time-homogeneous Markov chain
- period of a class! reference it in lemma for regular grammars DONE
- convergence of mutual information: sequences include indices; unify x_0 and x_\infty
- unify starting at 0 or 1 for random variables
- rework tensor networks
